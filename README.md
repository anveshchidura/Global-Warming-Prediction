# Global-Warming-Prediction
WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?
Global warming is the current increase in temperature of the earthâ€™s surface (both land and water) as well as it's atmosphere.

In the past, when the Earth experienced increases in temperature it was the result of natural causes but today it is being caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere produced by human activities.

We have used regression method to predict the global warming temperatures from 2016-2030 and suggest some preventive measures to curb global warming.
